      Aero Controls is the
      proud winner of Alliant’s Wellness Award for 2018! Alliant works with Aero
      Controls as our benefits broker and we were selected based on the wellness program
      we offer here. Employees graciously took part in a video that captured what
      wellness means to the people here and how it has affected not just life at
      work, but also outside of work. Click on one of the links below to see the

           <strong>Wellness Program Participants,</strong>
         </p>
         <p>
           <strong>
             We are near the end of the 1<sup>st</sup> quarter! Please remember to
             meet your <u>3 QWA requirement before March 31<sup>st</sup>.</u> If you
             do not meet this requirement, you will unfortunately be removed from
             the Wellness Program for the remainder of the year and your insurance
             premiums will increase to the non-wellness rate (which can be quite
             substantial for some folks!). Please make sure to check your QWA count
             at the link above. ‘
           </strong>
         </p>
         <p>
           <strong>
             ALSO – you must also make sure you have completed your Biometric
             Screening before March 31<sup>st</sup>. For those on our medical plan,
             the Health Risk Assessment is also required to be completed (at
             Premera.com). Details on both of these requirements are below and have
             been sent previously via email.
           </strong>
         </p>
         <div align="center">
           <hr size="0" width="100%" align="center" />
         </div>
         <p>
           <strong><em><u>Biometric Screenings On-Site - Closed</u></em></strong>
         </p>
         <p>
           Take an easy step towards a healthier you! The January biometric screening
           event gave you a chance to find out what your blood pressure, blood
           glucose, cholesterol, and BMI (body mass index) numbers are, and what they
           mean—free of charge. This screening gives you reliable information about
           your current and potential risk for preventable diseases such as diabetes,
           heart disease, and hypertension, so you and your health care provider can
           take steps toward preventing serious health problems in the future.
         </p>
         <p>
           <strong>
             <u>
               For current Wellness Program participants, the biometric screening
               is mandatory .
             </u>
           </strong>
           <strong> </strong>
           If you were unable to make it to either of the on-site biometric screening
           events in January, you can see your doctor directly to complete a screening
           and then fax in the provider form. The provider fax form can be found here:    <u><a href="file://aci-cluster/vol1/SHARE/INTERNET/Files/2019 Aero Controls Fax Form.pdf">Provider Fax Form</a></u>
         </p>
         <p>
           <strong>
             All participants will receive 1 QWA for completing the Biometric
             Screening either on-site or at their doctor’s office
           </strong>
         </p>
         <p>
           <strong>
             <em>
               <u>
                 Health Risk Assessment is available through Premera’s website!
               </u>
             </em>
           </strong>
         </p>
         <p>
           As some of you may know, each year we do a Health Risk Assessment
           Questionnaire as part of our Wellness Program requirements. These
           assessments help give you a picture of your overall health and allows you
           to see what you’re doing well and what areas may need some extra attention.
           Since we did this through Premera Blue Cross last year, most all of you
           should have a login with Premera to complete it again this year.
         </p>
         <p>
           Just like the biometric screening, completion of the questionnaire is    <strong>mandatory</strong> in order to remain on the Wellness Program (only
           if you are on the Premera medical plan). Failure to do so will result in
           removal from the Wellness Program and an increase in your insurance rates
           for the year.
         </p>
         <p>
           In order to complete the questionnaire, you must login with your
           credentials you created last year. If you are new to the Premera plan, you
           must create a login on the Premera webpage,    <a href="http://www.premera.com/">www.premera.com</a> (there is a quick
           link on the Aero Controls Intranet page as well). Simply go to Premera.com,
           click ‘Log In’ on the upper right side of the screen, and select ‘Create
           new account now’.
         </p>
         <p>
           Once your account is set up, please follow the instructions listed    <u><a href="file://aci-cluster/vol1/SHARE/INTERNET/Files/Premera's Online Health Assessment.pdf">here</a></u>
         </p>
         <p>
           You will want to set aside 15-20 minutes to complete the questionnaire. If
           you start it but cannot complete it until a later date, you may save and
           close the questionnaire window. It will pick up where you left off when you
           log back in. Premera will supply Aero Controls a report of all the
           employees that have completed the HRA, so screenshots or printouts are not
           required this year.
         </p>
         <p>
           The Health Risk Assessment Questionnaire must be completed no later than<strong>Sunday March 31</strong><strong><sup>st</sup></strong><strong>, 2019.</strong><strong>You will also receive (1) QWA for the 1</strong><strong><sup>st</sup></strong>    <strong> Quarter for completing the HRA.</strong>
         </p>
         <p>
           If you have any questions at all, please come see us in the Employee
           Resource Center.
